# *SeeFood-CoreML* üçî
SeeFood is an image recognition app that uses CoreML to identify images as food or non-food. Inspired by the HBO series Silicon Valley, this app provides a simple demonstration of machine learning‚Äôs capabilities in image classification.

# *Features*

Food Detection: Uses a pre-trained CoreML model to identify if an object is food or not.
Instant Feedback: Provides real-time classification results based on the photo taken or selected from the library.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple design that allows users to snap a picture and get instant results.

# *Technology Stack*

Swift: Integrates with CoreML and manages the user interface.

CoreML: Uses a machine learning model trained for food classification.

UIKit: Provides a straightforward interface for capturing and classifying images.

# *Getting Started*

Clone the repository and open the project in Xcode.
Run the app on an iOS simulator or device with a camera.
Take or select a photo to see if the app detects it as food or not.

# *About the Project*

SeeFood-CoreML is a great introduction to CoreML and image classification in iOS. It demonstrates how machine learning models can be integrated into mobile applications to provide fun and interactive features.
